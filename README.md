# Flutter Native Strings (WIP)

A command-line tool which simplifies the task of adding native Android and iOS string resources to your Flutter app.

## :briefcase: Use Case
A common use case for this is for implementing localized push notifications where the string resources are registered in the appropriate locations in the Android and iOS folders and keeping the two strings sources synced would be a pain.

## :construction: Progress
The project is at its initial stage and I'm excited to work on it.
